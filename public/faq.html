                            <h4 class="question">What are SIP Trunks?</h4>
                            <p class="answer">SIP Trunks are traditional Phone Lines delivered over the Internet. A SIP Trunk is the connection from your Internet enabled device to the traditional phone network.</p>

                            <a name="question2"></a>
                            <h4 class="question">What are the advantages of SIP Trunking rather than ISDN?</h4>
                            <p class="answer">SIP Trunking is cheaper than ISDN and has a number of features that physical connections cannot provide, such as automatic failover and multi-rate center numbering.</p>

                            <a name="question3"></a>
                            <h4 class="question">Who can use SIP Trunking? Who are the ideal customers?</h4>
                            <p class="answer">SIP Trunking can be used for any voice application, from Hosted PBX to Call Center. Customers who are using traditional voice services will see the most savings by converting to SIP, typically in the 60-80% range.</p>

                            <a name="question4"></a>
                            <h4 class="question">Do I need any additional equipment to use SIP Trunking?</h4>
                            <p class="answer">Most Legacy Phone Systems have built-in SIP Trunking capabilities, but some older models may require an adapter. Check with your manufacturer or our Forums for more details. Also, some manufacturers requires licensing to use SIP trunking, such as Avaya or Cisco. You’ll need to work with your Avaya or Cisco reseller to ensure you have the proper licensing or SIP Trunking will not work.</p>

                            <a name="question5"></a>
                            <h4 class="question">Do I need more bandwidth to use SIP Trunking?</h4>
                            <p class="answer">Each simultaneous call requires 64-100kilobits per second of free bandwidth. If you have a DSL line that’s 6 megabits down and 1 megabit up, you can have at least 10 calls if no other traffic is running over the network.</p>

                            <a name="question6"></a>
                            <h4 class="question">How many SIP Trunks do I need?</h4>
                            <p class="answer">Well that depends! You can have as many DIDs as you require for your service. The total number of simultaneous calls that can be made or received will be controlled by the number of trunks. They can be made to different DIDs or all to the same.</p>

                            <a name="question7"></a>
                            <h4 class="question">Are SIP Trunks expensive to implement?</h4>
                            <p class="answer">SIP Trunking is much cheaper than traditional voice over time. The cost of implementation is generally an hour of your time and nothing more. In rare instances, an adapter will need to be installed, but even that process won’t take more than an hour.</p>

                            <a name="question8"></a>
                            <h4 class="question">Are SIP Trunks reliable enough?</h4>
                            <p class="answer">SIP Trunking is used by major organizations all over the world. It is the backbone of Apple’s Facetime, Google’s Hangouts and most modern Communications Services. SIP is reliable enough to be trusted by the world’s most famous brands and it is used all over the world by leading organizations.</p>

                            <p class="answer">Faxing is always done on a best effort basis and SIP/VoIP has plenty of known issues with faxing, so you will want to make sure it works for you over our service. We recommend that you confirm the quality is acceptable before proceeding with a port request. We support t.38 for faxing, but please test everything. You should configure your trunk to use the G711 (ulaw) or t.38 codec for faxing. If you choose to proceed with a port, just follow the directions for any other number port.</p>
